I've previously worked as either a front end or full stack developer\n  in both the public and private sectors. Feel free to see some of my side projects via the github link, or my work experience via the\n  LinkedIn link. I am always willing to discuss starting new ideas and would love to get to know you.\n  </Paragraph>\n\n  <Paragraph>\n  My previous work experience has included many major front end frameworks - Ember.js, React, Angular, as well as framwork-free\n  environments. I am comfortable working in any although I have a preference toward Ember. Server side my professional experience\n  has been in Node.js (express, Sails), .NET, and my side project experience always seems to lead me back to Elixir/Phoenix. I love\n  the challenge of learning new languages or frameworks and would enjoy the opportunity to bring my previous experience to the table\n  or add a new skillset. I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n  </Paragraph>\n\n  <Paragraph>\n  -Joe\n  </Paragraph>\n\n  <Paragraph>\n  </Paragraph>\n  </Article>\n  </Body>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\n\nexport default About;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAzBA;AACA;AAgCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
