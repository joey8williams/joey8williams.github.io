My experience programming and design began when I was about 12, working with lua scripting as well as building static sites for fun. Growing up in small town Kentucky, there wasn't a ton of opportunity for learning how to program or design unless you had the desire to teach yourself. I always had viewed it as a hobby, and enjoyed math and physics more, so I began my college career as a Mechanical Engineer and University of Kentucky. I left most of my programming behind and focused entirely on developing my skills as an engineer until the end of my third year. There was a required course for MATLab, and working in MATLab sparked my desire for development again. The following semester, I switched my major to Computer Science, found a company willing to hire me to build static sites (via jekyll, WordPress, Shopify, and raw html/css/js) as well as some web apps (via EmberJs, ExpressJs). Working in those languages, while also learning Java, C, and SQL in school taught me that an expert level of knowledge with a language is helpful, but not nearly as much as having a solid approach to solving problems. This helped greatly in my transition to my development positions post college."), react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement(_styles_Paragraph__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__["default"], {
