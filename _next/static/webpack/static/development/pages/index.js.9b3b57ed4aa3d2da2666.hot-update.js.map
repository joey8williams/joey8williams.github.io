I work in the field of software development with a focus\n  on front end web development. My experience programming and design began when\n  I was about 12, working with lua scripting as well as building static sites for fun.\n  Growing up in small town Kentucky, there wasn't a ton of opportunity for learning\n  how to program or design unless you had the desire to teach yourself.\n  I always had viewed it as a hobby, and enjoyed math and physics more, so I began\n  my college career as a Mechanical Engineer at University of Kentucky. I left most\n  of my programming behind and focused entirely on developing my skills as an engineer\n  until the end of my third year. There was a required course for MATLab, and working\n  in MATLab sparked my desire for development again. The following semester, I switched\n  my major to Computer Science, found <Link href='https://awesomeinc.org' target=\"_blank\">Awesome Inc </Link>\n  who was willing to hire me to build static sites\n  (via jekyll, WordPress, Shopify, and raw html/css/js) as well as some web apps\n  (via EmberJs, ExpressJs). Working in those languages, while also learning\n  Java, C, and SQL in school taught me that an expert level of knowledge with a\n  language is helpful, but not nearly as much as having a solid approach to solving\n  problems. This helped greatly in my transition to my development positions post college.\n  </Paragraph>\n\n  <Paragraph>\n  Upon graduating I had received an offer to work for the Kentucky Transportation Department (KYTC)\n  as a full-stack web developer, in a Microsoft stack (SqlServer, C#/.NET, JQuery, Bootstrap).\n  Being at KYTC was my first experience working\n  with large code bases that I didn't write, and having to make changes to that code\n  that didn't break the application. This quickly brought about the lesson of writing code\n  that scales. The more I could refactor and reuse code, and the more it could be\n  decoupled (within reason) the easier changes down the road became. The value of spending\n  the extra time up front desigining, reworking, and implementing these designs massively\n  cut down on the time it took to fix bugs, as well as extend the application. Since we worked\n  with JQuery, design patterns were left more or less up to developer writing the application.\n  I enjoyed the flexibility to experiment, and it helped when I moved into modern (NodeJs) front end tooling\n  and frameworks. Today I am seeking work as a React Developer, or as a Phoenix/Elixir developer, ideally both.\n  </Paragraph>\n\n  <Paragraph>\n  Outside of work I enjoy traveling, learning about other cultures, kayaking, and music. I believe new experiences\n  are the key to growth, and exploration/experimentation is the only way to have those new experiences.

Thank you and enjoy!\n  </Paragraph>\n  </Article>\n\n\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default Index;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAWA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAeA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA/CA;AACA;AAyDA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
