This lead me down a path to try something\n        new by leaning on more familiar languages: HTML, and CSS via Sass\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n        The resume is divided into 4 distinct sections: Contact,\n        Employment, Education, and Skills. The entire page is laid\n        with CSS grid. All sub sections are laid out with CSS grid as well,\n        with exception to the Skills section.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n        The Skills section has 3 categories that are spaced via flexbox.\n        Each category contains child nodes with are spaced by yet another\n        display:flex. I went this route over CSS grid because it made\n        adding skills MUCH simpler.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n        By this time I had all of my sections laid out, had all of their\n        respective CSS divided into SCSS files and imported into a main file,\n        and had spent more time than I care to admit refactoring reused SCSS into\n        mixins. I decided to go one step further - why not add external libraries\n        into the mix? I leaned on <a href='https://fontawesome.com'>FontAwesome </a>\n         and <a href='https://tachyons.io' target=\"_blank\">Tachyons CSS </a>\n        to take care of all the icons and styling.\n\n        </Paragraph>\n      </TextWrapper>\n    </FlexView>\n\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Resume;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAOA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAlCA;AACA;AA2CA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
