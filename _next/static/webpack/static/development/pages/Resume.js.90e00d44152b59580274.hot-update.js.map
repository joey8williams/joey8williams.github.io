The entire page is laid\n        with CSS grid. All sub sections are laid out with CSS grid as well,\n        with exception to the Skills section.\n        </Paragraph>\n        <Paragraph>\n        The Skills section has 3 categories that are spaced via flexbox.\n        Each category contains child nodes with are spaced by yet another\n        display:flex. I went this route over CSS grid because it made\n        adding skills MUCH simpler.\n        </Paragraph>\n      </TextWrapper>\n    </FlexView>\n\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default Resume;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAOA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAtBA;AACA;AAiCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
