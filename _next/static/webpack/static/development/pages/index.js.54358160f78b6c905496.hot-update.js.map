I work in the field of software development with a focus\n  on front end web development. My experience programming and design began when\n  I was about 12, working with lua scripting as well as building static sites for fun.\n  Growing up in small town Kentucky, there wasn't a ton of opportunity for learning\n  how to program or design unless you had the desire to teach yourself.\n  I always had viewed it as a hobby, and enjoyed math and physics more, so I began\n  my college career as a Mechanical Engineer and University of Kentucky. I left most\n  of my programming behind and focused entirely on developing my skills as an engineer\n  until the end of my third year. There was a required course for MATLab, and working\n  in MATLab sparked my desire for development again. The following semester, I switched\n  my major to Computer Science, found a company willing to hire me to build static sites\n  (via jekyll, WordPress, Shopify, and raw html/css/js) as well as some web apps\n  (via EmberJs, ExpressJs). Working in those languages, while also learning\n  Java, C, and SQL in school taught me that an expert level of knowledge with a\n  language is helpful, but not nearly as much as having a solid approach to solving\n  problems. This helped greatly in my transition to my development positions post college.\n  </Paragraph>\n\n  <Paragraph>\n  Upon graduating I had received an offer to work for the Kentucky Transportation Department (KYTC)\n  as a full-stack web developer. We worked in a Microsoft stack (SqlServer, C#/.NET, JQuery, Bootstrap)\n  all of these were new technologies for me but thanks to great tooling they were\n  relatively easy to grasp.\n  </Paragraph>\n  </Article>\n\n\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default Index;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAmBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AA9BA;AACA;AAyCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
