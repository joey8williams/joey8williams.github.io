I work in the field of software development with a focus\n  on front end web development. My experience programming and design began when\n  I was about 12, working with lua scripting as well as building static sites for fun.\n  Growing up in small town Kentucky, there wasn't a ton of opportunity for learning\n  how to program or design unless you had the desire to teach yourself.\n  I always had viewed it as a hobby, and enjoyed math and physics more, so I began\n  my college career as a Mechanical Engineer. I left most of my programming\n  behind and focused entirely on developing my skills as an engineer until the end of\n  my third year. There was a required course for MATLab, and working in MATLab sparked\n  my desire for development again. The following semester, I switched my major to\n  Computer Science, found a company willing to hire me to build static sites\n  (via jekyll, WordPress, Shopify, and raw html/css/js) as well as some web apps\n  (via EmberJs, ExpressJs).\n\n\n  </Paragraph>\n  </Article>\n\n\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default Index;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAXA;AACA;AAiCA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
