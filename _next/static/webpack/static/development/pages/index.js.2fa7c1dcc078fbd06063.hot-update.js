My experience programming and design began when I was about 12, working with lua scripting as well as building static sites for fun. Growing up in small town Kentucky, there wasn't a ton of opportunity for learning how to program or design unless you had the desire to teach yourself. I always had viewed it as a hobby, and enjoyed math and physics more, so I began my college career as a Mechanical Engineer at University of Kentucky. I left most of my programming behind and focused entirely on developing my skills as an engineer until the end of my third year. There was a required course for MATLab, and working in MATLab sparked my desire for development again.

Being at KYTC was my first experience working with large code bases that I didn't write, and having to make changes to that code that didn't break the application. This quickly brought about the lesson of writing code that scales. The more I could refactor and reuse code, and the more it could be decoupled (within reason) the easier changes down the road became. The value of spending the extra time up front desigining, reworking, and implementing these designs massively cut down on the time it took to fix bugs, as well as extend the application. Since we worked with JQuery, design patterns were left more or less up to developer writing the application. I enjoyed the flexibility to experiment, and it helped when I moved into modern (NodeJs) front end tooling and frameworks. Today I am seeking work as a React Developer, or as a Phoenix/Elixir developer, ideally both."), react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default.a.createElement(_styles_Paragraph__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__["default"], {
